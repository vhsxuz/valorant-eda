## Introduction
Valorant is a first-person team-based game developed by a game developers company called “Riot Games”. The game was introduced on April 7, 2020, under the codename “Project A” and it was released on June 2, 2020. With a similar concept to CSGO (Counter Strike Global Offensive), this game comes with two teams with each team consisting of 5 players. The difference is, in Valorant, every agent or hero has a special skill to add to the excitement of the battle. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played


## Analysis Purpose
The analysis was carried out to analyze the agent’s data on Valorant, starting from the frequency chosen by the player, the percentage of wins, the effectiveness of the character in killing the opponent's character, and so on which concluded in the results in the form of a gameplay meta in Episode 4 Act 3 Valorant, especially about the gameplay balancing on every agent and weapons.


## The Benefit of the EDA
Through the results of data analysis, the game development team can decide what steps should be taken next to improve the meta gameplay and still maintain the balance of the gameplay by nerfing some overpowered agents and giving buffs to agents that are considered unplayable by most of the players.

## Dataset
In conducting the analysis, the dataset used is the Valorant leaderboard statistics dataset obtained from Kaggle with the site https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aliibrahim10/valorant-stats which the dataset contains data on the performance of Valorant players in various regions in Valorant episode 4 act 3.

## Methodology
The Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) was carried out using the python programming language and using various libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, and pyspark. Pyspark is the library in charge of processing the data which is then converted into pandas format so that it can be visualized easily. The results of the data that have been converted into pandas will be visualized through the functions contained in the matplotlib library. The whole process is carried out with the help of Google Colab as a place to run the program.
